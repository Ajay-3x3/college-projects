PROJECT SYNOPSIS
On
Traffic lights controller using Arduino
ABSTRACT: -
The use of private vehicles is extremely common and as a result, the quantity of vehicles on the roads area unit exponentially increasing. 
Roads with none direction or steering will lead in to traffic congestions and accidents.
Traffic Lights or Traffic Signals area unit signalling devices that area unit accustomed management the flow of traffic. 
Generally, they're positioned at junctions, intersections, ‘X’ roads, pedestrian crossings etc.
The traffic lights can offer directions to the users (drivers and pedestrians) by displaying lights of normal colour. 
The 3 colours utilized in traffic lights area unit Red, Yellow and green.
The system should be accustomed management the traffic lights for swish and safe movement of traffic. 
These management systems include electro mechanical controllers with mechanism mechanisms or trendy solid-state processed systems with simple setup and maintenance.
In this project, associate degree Arduino based mostly traffic signal Controller system is meant. 
it's a straightforward implementation of traffic lights system however is extended to a true time system with programmable timings, pedestrian lighting etc.
